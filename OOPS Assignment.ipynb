       "'1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\\n\\n-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects \\nrather than just functions and logic. It helps in writing modular, reusable, and scalable code.\\n\\nOOP is based on four main principles:\\n\\na.Encapsulation\\na.1. Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) inside a single unit called class.\\na.2. Restricts direct access to some of the object\\'s components.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass BankAccount:\\n    def __init__(self, balance):\\n        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\\n    def deposit(self, amount):\\n        self.__balance += amount\\n    def get_balance(self):\\n        return self.__balance  # Accessing private data via method\\naccount = BankAccount(1000)\\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000\\n\\nb.Inheritance\\nAllows one class (child) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (parent).\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Animal:\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Some sound\"\\nclass Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Bark!\"\\ndog = Dog()\\nprint(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark!\\n\\nc.Polymorphism \\nAllows methods with the same name to behave differently based on the object calling them.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Bird:\\n    def fly(self):\\n        return \"Some birds can fly\"\\nclass Sparrow(Bird):\\n    def fly(self):\\n        return \"Sparrow can fly high\"\\nclass Penguin(Bird):\\n    def fly(self):\\n        return \"Penguins cannot fly\"\\nbirds = [Sparrow(), Penguin()]\\nfor bird in birds:\\n    print(bird.fly())  \\nOutput:\\nSparrow can fly high\\nPenguins cannot fly\\n\\nd.Abstraction\\nd.1.Hides implementation details and exposes only the necessary functionality.\\nd.2.Achieved using abstract classes (classes that cannot be instantiated).\\n\\nExample:\\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\\nclass Animal(ABC):\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def sound(self):\\n        pass  # No implementation\\nclass Dog(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Bark!\"\\ndog = Dog()\\nprint(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark!\\n\\n2. What is a class in OOP?\\n\\n->  The class is a user-defined data structure that combines the methods and data members into a single \\nentity. For the production of objects, classes serve as blueprints or code templates. We can make as many \\nobjects as we desire using a class.\\n\\nclass Car:\\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\\n        self.brand = brand      # Attribute\\n        self.model = model      # Attribute\\n        self.year = year        # Attribute\\n    def car_info(self):         # Method\\n        return f\"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}\"\\n# Creating objects (instances) of the class\\ncar1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\\ncar2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2022)\\n# Calling method\\nprint(car1.car_info())  #  Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla\\nprint(car2.car_info())  #  Output: 2022 Honda Civic\\n\\n3. What is an object in OOP?\\n\\n-> An instance of a class is an object. It consists of a set of methods and attributes. Actions are carried \\nout using a class\\'s object. Objects have two qualities: They exhibit states and actions. (The object is equipped \\nwith properties and methods) Methods represent its behaviour, while attributes represent its state. We can alter \\nits status by using its techniques.\\n Every object has following properties:\\n Identity:Any object needs to have unique identification.\\n State:An attribute of an object reflects both the properties and the state of the object.\\n Behaviour:Methods represent the behaviour of an object.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nclass Car:\\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\\n        self.brand = brand      # Attribute\\n        self.model = model      # Attribute\\n        self.year = year        # Attribute\\n    def car_info(self):         # Method\\n        return f\"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}\"\\n# Creating objects (instances) of the class\\ncar1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\\ncar2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2022)\\n# Calling method\\nprint(car1.car_info())  #  Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla\\nprint(car2.car_info())  #  Output: 2022 Honda Civic\\n\\n4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\\n\\n-> Abstraction:\\nDefinition: Hiding implementation details and only showing essential features.\\nImplementation: Achieved using abstract classes.\\n\\nExample:\\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\\nclass Animal(ABC):\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def sound(self):\\n        pass  # No implementation\\nclass Dog(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Bark!\"\\ndog = Dog()\\nprint(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark!\\n\\nEncapsulation:\\nDefinition: Hiding data to prevent direct access and modifying it through controlled methods.\\nImplementation: Achieved using private/protected variables with getter and setter methods.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass BankAccount:\\n    def __init__(self, balance):\\n        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\\n    def deposit(self, amount):\\n        self.__balance += amount\\n    def get_balance(self):\\n        return self.__balance  # Accessing private data via method\\naccount = BankAccount(1000)\\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000\\n\\n5. What are dunder methods in Python?\\n\\n-> Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods \\nthat are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __method__). They allow us to define the behavior of\\nour objects for built-in operations.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Person:\\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\\n        self.name = name\\n        self.age = age\\n    def __str__(self):\\n        return f\"Person({self.name}, {self.age} years old)\"\\nperson = Person(\"Bob\", 30)\\nprint(person)  # Output: Person(Bob, 30 years old)\\n\\n6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\\n\\n-> Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (parent).\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Animal:\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Some sound\"\\nclass Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Bark!\"\\ndog = Dog()\\nprint(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark!\\n\\n7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\\n\\n-> Polymorphism allows methods with the same name to behave differently based on the object calling them.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Bird:\\n    def fly(self):\\n        return \"Some birds can fly\"\\nclass Sparrow(Bird):\\n    def fly(self):\\n        return \"Sparrow can fly high\"\\nclass Penguin(Bird):\\n    def fly(self):\\n        return \"Penguins cannot fly\"\\nbirds = [Sparrow(), Penguin()]\\nfor bird in birds:\\n    print(bird.fly())  \\nOutput:\\nSparrow can fly high\\nPenguins cannot fly\\n\\n8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\\n\\n-> Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using private and protected attributes with getter and setter methods\\nto access or modify them.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass BankAccount:\\n    def __init__(self, balance):\\n        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\\n    def deposit(self, amount):\\n        self.__balance += amount\\n    def get_balance(self):\\n        return self.__balance  # Accessing private data via method\\naccount = BankAccount(1000)\\nprint(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000\\n\\n9. What is a constructor in Python?\\n\\n-> A constructor is a special method in Python used to initialize an object\\'s attributes \\nwhen an instance of a class is created.\\nIn Python, the constructor method is named __init__(), and it is automatically called when a new object is instantiated.\\n\\nSyntax:\\nclass ClassName:\\n    def __init__(self, parameters):\\n        # Initialize object attributes\\n        self.attribute = value\\n\\nTypes of constructors:\\n1.Default Constructor(No Parameters)\\nA constructor without parameters (except self), initializing attributes with default values.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Example:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        print(\"This is a default constructor\")\\nobj = Example() # Output: This is a default constructor\\n\\n2.Parameterized Constructor\\nA constructor that accepts parameters to initialize object attributes.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Car:\\n    def __init__(self, brand, model):\\n        self.brand = brand\\n        self.model = model\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(f\"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}\")\\ncar1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\\ncar1.show() # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla\\n\\n3.Constructor with Default Arguments\\nIf values are not provided, default values are used.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Student:\\n    def __init__(self, name=\"Unknown\", age=18):\\n        self.name = name\\n        self.age = age\\ns1 = Student()\\ns2 = Student(\"John\", 22)\\nprint(s1.name, s1.age)  # Output: Unknown 18\\nprint(s2.name, s2.age)  # Output: John 22\\n\\n10. What are class and static methods in Python?\\n\\n-> Class methods:\\nClass methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or \\nmodify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the \\n@classmethod decorator.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Employee:\\n    company = \"Google\"  # Class attribute\\n    @classmethod\\n    def change_company(cls, new_company):\\n        cls.company = new_company  # Modifies the class attribute\\n# Calling class method using the class itself\\nEmployee.change_company(\"Microsoft\")\\nprint(Employee.company)  # Output: Microsoft\\n\\nStatic methods:\\nStatic methods are methods that belong to the class and don\\'t access or modify class or instance state. They \\nare defined using the @staticmethod decorator. \\n\\nExample:\\nclass MathOperations:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def add(x, y):\\n        return x + y\\n# Calling static method using the class\\nresult = MathOperations.add(10, 5)\\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\\n\\n11. What is method overloading in Python?\\n\\n-> Method overloading is a feature that allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name \\nbut different parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading like other languages\\nbecause Python functions can accept a variable number of arguments using default parameters or *args and **kwargs.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Calculator:\\n    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\\n        return a + b + c\\ncalc = Calculator()\\nprint(calc.add(5))         # Output: 5\\nprint(calc.add(5, 10))     # Output: 15\\nprint(calc.add(5, 10, 15)) # Output: 30\\n\\n12. What is method overriding in OOP?\\n\\n-> Method Overriding is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides a \\nspecific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\\n\\nThe overridden method in the child class should have:\\na.The same name as the method in the parent class.\\nb.The same parameters as the method in the parent class.\\nc.A different implementation from the parent class.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Animal:\\n    def speak(self):\\n        print(\"Animals make sounds.\")\\nclass Dog(Animal):\\n    def speak(self):  # Overriding the parent method\\n        print(\"Dog barks.\")\\nclass Cat(Animal):\\n    def speak(self):  # Overriding the parent method\\n        print(\"Cat meows.\")\\n# Creating objects\\ndog = Dog()\\ncat = Cat()\\ndog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks.\\ncat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows.\\n\\n13. What is a property decorator in Python?\\n\\n-> In Python, the @property decorator is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute. \\nIt allows controlled access to a class attribute, making it read-only or modifiable while maintaining encapsulation.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Employee:\\n    def __init__(self, name, salary):\\n        self.name = name\\n        self._salary = salary  # Private attribute\\n    @property\\n    def salary(self):  # Getter method\\n        print(\"Getting salary...\")\\n        return self._salary\\n    @salary.setter\\n    def salary(self, new_salary):  # Setter method\\n        if new_salary < 0:\\n            print(\"Salary cannot be negative!\")\\n        else:\\n            print(\"Updating salary...\")\\n            self._salary = new_salary\\n    @salary.deleter\\n    def salary(self):  # Deleter method\\n        print(\"Deleting salary...\")\\n        del self._salary\\n# Creating an object\\nemp = Employee(\"John\", 50000)\\nprint(emp.salary)  # Calls the getter method\\nemp.salary = 60000  # Calls the setter method\\ndel emp.salary  # Calls the deleter method\\n\\n14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\\n\\n-> Polymorphism is important in OOP because:\\n\\na.Code Reusability – Use the same method for different objects.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Animal:\\n    def sound(self):\\n        pass\\nclass Dog(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Bark\"\\nclass Cat(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Meow\"\\nanimals = [Dog(), Cat()]\\nfor animal in animals:\\n    print(animal.sound())  # Bark, Meow\\n\\n    \\nb.Method Overriding – Subclasses redefine inherited methods.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Parent:\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(\"Parent class\")\\nclass Child(Parent):\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(\"Child class\")\\nobj = Child()\\nobj.show()  # Child class\\n\\nc.Operator Overloading – Customize operators for user-defined objects.\\n\\nclass Vector:\\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\\n        self.x = x\\n        self.y = y\\n    def __add__(self, other):\\n        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\\nv1 = Vector(2, 3)\\nv2 = Vector(4, 5)\\nresult = v1 + v2  # Uses __add__\\nprint(result.x, result.y)  # 6, 8\\n\\nd.Flexibility & Scalability – Works with new classes without modifying existing code.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Bird:\\n    def fly(self):\\n        print(\"Some birds can fly\")\\nclass Sparrow(Bird):\\n    def fly(self):\\n        print(\"Sparrow can fly\")\\nclass Penguin(Bird):\\n    def fly(self):\\n        print(\"Penguins can\\'t fly\")\\nbirds = [Sparrow(), Penguin()]\\nfor bird in birds:\\n    bird.fly()\\n\\n15. What is an abstract class in Python?\\n\\n-> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated \\nand contains at least one abstract method (a method with no implementation).\\nIt provides a blueprint for subclasses to enforce method implementation.\\n\\nExample:\\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\\nclass Animal(ABC):  # Abstract class\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def sound(self):\\n        pass  # Must be implemented in subclasses\\nclass Dog(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Bark\"\\nclass Cat(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        return \"Meow\"\\nobj = Dog()\\nprint(obj.sound())  # Bark\\n\\n16. What are the advantages of OOP?\\n\\n-> Advantages of OOP include:\\na.Encapsulation – Bundles data and methods, restricting access to internal state.   \\nb.Inheritance – Reuse code and create hierarchical relationships.\\nc.Polymorphism – Use the same interface for different data types, enhancing flexibility.\\nd.Abstraction – Simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.\\ne.Code Reusability – Write once, use multiple times, reducing redundancy.\\nf.Modularity – Breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.\\n\\n17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\\n\\n->  One child class may inherit from several parent classes when there is multiple inheritance.\\nThis allows the child class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Parent1:\\n    def feature1(self):\\n        return \"Feature 1 from Parent1\"\\nclass Parent2:\\n    def feature2(self):\\n        return \"Feature 2 from Parent2\"\\nclass Child(Parent1, Parent2):  # Multiple Inheritance\\n    def feature3(self):\\n        return \"Feature 3 from Child\"\\nobj = Child()\\nprint(obj.feature1())  # Output: Feature 1 from Parent1\\nprint(obj.feature2())  # Output: Feature 2 from Parent2\\nprint(obj.feature3())  # Output: Feature 3 from Child\\n\\n18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\\n\\n-> Instance variable : Instance variables are properties that are joined to a class instance. In the \\nconstructor (the class\\'s init() method), we define instance variables.\\n\\nClass variable : A variable that is declared inside a class but outside of any instance methods or init() \\nmethods is referred to as a class variable.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Car:\\n    wheels = 4  # Class variable (shared by all instances)\\n    def __init__(self, brand, color):\\n        self.brand = brand  # Instance variable (unique per object)\\n        self.color = color  # Instance variable (unique per object)\\n# Creating objects\\ncar1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Red\")\\ncar2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Blue\")\\nprint(car1.brand, car1.color, car1.wheels)  # Toyota Red 4\\nprint(car2.brand, car2.color, car2.wheels)  # Honda Blue 4\\n# Modifying instance variable\\ncar1.color = \"Black\"\\nprint(car1.color)  # Black\\n# Modifying class variable\\nCar.wheels = 6\\nprint(car1.wheels, car2.wheels)  # 6 6 (shared change)\\n\\n19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__\" and \"__repr__\" methods in Python.\\n\\n-> __str__ method: This method is called when the str() function is used on an instance of the class. It should \\nreturn a string representation of the object.\\n\\n__repr__ method: This method is called when the repr() function is used on an instance of the class. It \\nshould return an unambiguous string representation of the object, which can be used to recreate the \\nobject.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Car:\\n    def __init__(self, brand, color):\\n        self.brand = brand\\n        self.color = color\\n    def __str__(self):\\n        return f\"Car: {self.brand}, Color: {self.color}\"  # Readable format\\n    def __repr__(self):\\n        return f\"Car(\\'{self.brand}\\', \\'{self.color}\\')\"  # Exact representation\\n# Creating an object\\ncar = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Red\")\\n# Using __str__\\nprint(car)  # Output: Car: Toyota, Color: Red\\n# Using __repr__\\nprint(repr(car))  # Output: Car(\\'Toyota\\', \\'Red\\')\\n\\n20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\\n\\n-> The super() function is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class. \\nIt is mainly used in inheritance to avoid directly referring to the parent class.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Parent:\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(\"This is the Parent class.\")\\nclass Child(Parent):\\n    def show(self):\\n        super().show()  # Calls Parent\\'s show()\\n        print(\"This is the Child class.\")\\nchild = Child()\\nchild.show()\\n# Output:\\n# This is the Parent class.\\n# This is the Child class.\\n\\n21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\\n\\n-> The __del__ method is a destructor in Python, called automatically when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\\nIt is used to free up resources like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Example:\\n    def __init__(self, name):\\n        self.name = name\\n        print(f\"Object {self.name} created.\")\\n    def __del__(self):\\n        print(f\"Object {self.name} deleted.\")\\nobj = Example(\"A\")  \\ndel obj  # Calls __del__()\\n# Output:\\n# Object A created.\\n# Object A deleted.\\n\\n22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\\n\\n-> A @staticmethod does not access the class (cls) or instance (self). \\nIt is used for utility functions that don’t modify class attributes.\\n\\nA @classmethod takes cls as a parameter and can modify class-level attributes. \\nIt is used when a method needs to work with the class itself rather than instance data.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Example:\\n    class_variable = 10\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def static_method():\\n        print(\"I am a static method.\")\\n    @classmethod\\n    def class_method(cls):\\n        print(f\"I am a class method. class_variable = {cls.class_variable}\")\\n# Calling methods\\nExample.static_method()   # Works without instance\\nExample.class_method()    # Works without instance\\n# Output:\\n# I am a static method.\\n# I am a class method. class_variable = 10\\n\\n23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\\n\\n-> Polymorphism allows a single method to be used with different types of objects, \\nenabling flexibility and reusability. When a method is overridden in a derived class, \\nthe derived class\\'s version is called instead of the parent class\\'s version.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Animal:\\n    def sound(self):\\n        print(\"Animals make sound\")\\nclass Dog(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        print(\"Dog barks\")\\nclass Cat(Animal):\\n    def sound(self):\\n        print(\"Cat meows\")\\n# Polymorphism in action\\nanimals = [Dog(), Cat()]\\nfor animal in animals:\\n    animal.sound()\\n# Output:\\n# Dog barks\\n# Cat meows\\n\\n24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\\n\\n-> Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, \\nimproving readability and efficiency. This is achieved by returning self from each method.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Person:\\n    def set_name(self, name):\\n        self.name = name\\n        return self  # Enables chaining\\n    def set_age(self, age):\\n        self.age = age\\n        return self  # Enables chaining\\n    def show(self):\\n        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\\n        return self  # Enables further chaining\\n# Using method chaining\\nperson = Person().set_name(\"Alice\").set_age(25).show()\\n# Output:\\n# Name: Alice, Age: 25\\n\\n25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\\n\\n-> The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. \\nThis makes objects behave like functions while still maintaining their state.\\n\\nExample:\\nclass Multiplier:\\n    def __init__(self, factor):\\n        self.factor = factor\\n\\n    def __call__(self, num):\\n        return num * self.factor\\n\\ndouble = Multiplier(2)  # Create an instance\\nprint(double(5))  # Call the instance like a function\\n# Output: 10\\n'"

    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "->  The class is a user-defined data structure that combines the methods and data members into a single \n",
    "entity. For the production of objects, classes serve as blueprints or code templates. We can make as many \n",
    "objects as we desire using a class.\n",

    "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> An instance of a class is an object. It consists of a set of methods and attributes. Actions are carried \n",
    "out using a class's object. Objects have two qualities: They exhibit states and actions. (The object is equipped \n",
    "with properties and methods) Methods represent its behaviour, while attributes represent its state. We can alter \n",
    "its status by using its techniques.\n",
    " Every object has following properties:\n",
    " Identity:Any object needs to have unique identification.\n",
    " State:An attribute of an object reflects both the properties and the state of the object.\n",
    " Behaviour:Methods represent the behaviour of an object.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods \n",
    "that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __method__). They allow us to define the behavior of\n",
    "our objects for built-in operations.\n",

    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (parent).\n",

    "print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark!\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Polymorphism allows methods with the same name to behave differently based on the object calling them.\n",

    "Penguins cannot fly\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using private and protected attributes with getter and setter methods\n",

    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> A constructor is a special method in Python used to initialize an object's attributes \n",
    "when an instance of a class is created.\n",
    "In Python, the constructor method is named __init__(), and it is automatically called when a new object is instantiated.\n",

    "Syntax:\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameters):\n",
    "        # Initialize object attributes\n",
    "        self.attribute = value\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of constructors:\n",
    "1.Default Constructor(No Parameters)\n",
    "A constructor without parameters (except self), initializing attributes with default values.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a default constructor\")\n",
    "obj = Example() # Output: This is a default constructor\n",

    "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Class methods:\n",
    "Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or \n",
    "modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the \n",

    "print(Employee.company)  # Output: Microsoft\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods:\n",
    "Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They \n",
    "are defined using the @staticmethod decorator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add(x, y):\n",
    "        return x + y\n",

    "print(result)  # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Method overloading is a feature that allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name \n",
    "but different parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading like other languages\n",
    "because Python functions can accept a variable number of arguments using default parameters or *args and **kwargs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n",

    "\n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Method Overriding is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides a \n",
    "specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overridden method in the child class should have:\n",
    "a.The same name as the method in the parent class.\n",
    "b.The same parameters as the method in the parent class.\n",
    "c.A different implementation from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> In Python, the @property decorator is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute. \n",
    "It allows controlled access to a class attribute, making it read-only or modifiable while maintaining encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The super() function is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class. \n",
    "It is mainly used in inheritance to avoid directly referring to the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is the Parent class.\")\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        super().show()  # Calls Parent's show()\n",
    "        print(\"This is the Child class.\")\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "child.show()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# This is the Parent class.\n",
    "# This is the Child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The __del__ method is a destructor in Python, called automatically when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n",
    "It is used to free up resources like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        print(f\"Object {self.name} created.\")\n",
    "    def __del__(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Object {self.name} deleted.\")\n",
    "obj = Example(\"A\")  \n",
    "del obj  # Calls __del__()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Object A created.\n",
    "# Object A deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> A @staticmethod does not access the class (cls) or instance (self). \n",
    "It is used for utility functions that don’t modify class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A @classmethod takes cls as a parameter and can modify class-level attributes. \n",
    "It is used when a method needs to work with the class itself rather than instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    class_variable = 10\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def static_method():\n",
    "        print(\"I am a static method.\")\n",

    "    def class_method(cls):\n",
    "        print(f\"I am a class method. class_variable = {cls.class_variable}\")\n",
    "# Calling methods\n",
    "Example.static_method()   # Works without instance\n",
    "Example.class_method()    # Works without instance\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# I am a static method.\n",
    "# I am a class method. class_variable = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Polymorphism allows a single method to be used with different types of objects, \n",
    "enabling flexibility and reusability. When a method is overridden in a derived class, \n",
    "the derived class's version is called instead of the parent class's version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animals make sound\")\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
    "# Polymorphism in action\n",
    "animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",
    "    animal.sound()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Dog barks\n",
    "# Cat meows\n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, \n",
    "improving readability and efficiency. This is achieved by returning self from each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        return self  # Enables chaining\n",
    "    def set_age(self, age):\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        return self  # Enables chaining\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\n",
    "        return self  # Enables further chaining\n",
    "# Using method chaining\n",
    "person = Person().set_name(\"Alice\").set_age(25).show()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Name: Alice, Age: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. \n",
    "This makes objects behave like functions while still maintaining their state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Multiplier:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, factor):\n",
    "        self.factor = factor\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __call__(self, num):\n",
    "        return num * self.factor\n",
    "\n",
    "double = Multiplier(2)  # Create an instance\n",
    "print(double(5))  # Call the instance like a function\n",
    "# Output: 10\n",
